by misana Nov 08, 2011
Welcome!

My oldest friend told me when she started play Gaia Online from very first date of this games coming. She told me trick to use emotions fast, for fun or just trolling around.

There are few examples for start:

/lol = The first, happy emotion. :D

/kiss =Simple, perverts fav emotion. u3u

/wink =Wink, wink ;D

/huh = what the hell? o.O

/cry = yeah, cry baby your face wet! ;_;

/ninja = Nin, Nin.

These are some, but try figure out more. Im slow and slobby so you can find these all and use them for good. ;D
