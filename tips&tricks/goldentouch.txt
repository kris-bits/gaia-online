Secret - Thousands of Gold in 3 days.
by ninja-shadow-battle May 14, 2009

You know how when you first register, you can't buy a trading pass for 3 days.
Step 1. Make several E-mail accounts. (write the emails with their passwords down so you don't forget)
Step 2. Make several Gaia accounts.
Step 3. Do Moiras quest once youve made the account individualy, don't forget the aquarium quest.
Step 4. Do the daily chance every day, also check your aquarium for special prizes.
Step 5. On the day you get the trading pass, trade everything over to YOUR ORIGINAL account. (Sell the starter stuff cuse its lame.)
Boom after at least 3 days you have maybe over 10k and hopefully a special item or more. You can wait for the trading pass for even longer so you trade more money(and possibly even items) and become a millionaire. Also keep those accounts open and continue step 4, and trade to your original every once in a while (you'll be happy you did).
